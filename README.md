## Introduction

[MailPal](https://mailpal.cc) lets you create unique email aliases for every service you sign up to — so your real address is never exposed. When an alias gets spammy, disable it in one click. Every alias forwards to your real inbox, invisibly.

Unlike other alias services, **MailPal runs entirely inside your own Cloudflare account**. Your emails never touch a third-party server. Zero subscriptions, zero data sharing — just your Workers, your KV, and your rules.

Try the [live demo](https://demo.mailpal.cc) to see how it works, or read on for setup instructions and implementation details.

## Screenshots

**Main dashboard** — stats bar, quick-create form, full alias list across all domains with tags, notes, and per-alias forwarded/blocked counts:

![Main dashboard](static/screenshots/dashboard.png)

**Alias detail** — expand any alias to edit its target address, note, tags, and expiry settings, or view its activity log:

**Domain filtering** — click a domain in the sidebar to scope the list; color-coded dots keep multi-domain setups easy to navigate:

**Tag filtering** — create named color tags and filter aliases by one or more tags to find what you need instantly:

## Features

- **Your real inbox, never exposed** – 
Give every service its own alias. When one goes spammy, kill it in one click, without changing your real address or losing your other accounts.

- **Total control, zero subscriptions** – 
MailPal runs entirely inside your own Cloudflare account on the free tier. No monthly fees, no vendor lock-in, no third-party servers ever seeing your mail.

- **Smart aliases that manage themselves** –
Set an expiry date or a max-forward limit and aliases disable themselves automatically. Enable wildcard mode and MailPal auto-creates a new alias the first time any address at your domain receives mail.

- **Always know what's happening** – 
Every alias tracks forwarded and blocked counts plus a per-alias activity log, so you can see exactly which service leaked your address and when.

- **Built for real workflows** – 
Add notes, assign color tags, and use full-text search to find any alias in seconds. Bulk-enable, bulk-disable, or bulk-delete when you need to act fast. Manage multiple domains from a single dashboard.

- **SimpleLogin-compatible API** – 
Set an `SL_API_KEY` and official SimpleLogin clients — including Bitwarden's "Forwarded email alias" generator — can create and manage aliases on your domains directly. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## How it works

> Note: this project has been built with the use of AI tools like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot/Agents. 

```
mailpal/                        ← SvelteKit dashboard → Cloudflare Pages
└── email-worker/               ← Email handler       → Cloudflare Worker
```

Both share one KV namespace. The **SvelteKit app** provides the management UI and a REST API for all alias, domain, tag, and destination operations. The **email worker** intercepts every incoming message on your domain and decides — based on KV state — whether to forward it, reject it, or auto-create a new alias in wildcard mode.

When a message arrives:
1. The worker looks up the alias in KV
2. If active: it forwards to the configured target inbox and appends an entry to the alias activity log
3. If disabled, expired, or over-limit: it rejects silently and logs a blocked entry
4. If no alias exists and wildcard mode is on: it auto-creates one and forwards

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account
- A domain added to Cloudflare (DNS managed by Cloudflare)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed for running setup scripts and managing dependencies
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed and authenticated (`wrangler login`)

### Quick setup (recommended)

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://mailpal.cc/install | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
irm https://mailpal.cc/install | iex
```

This will download the setup executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/betahuhn/mailpal/releases/latest), and run it automatically.

The setup executable will authenticate with Cloudflare, clone this repo, create a KV namespace, deploy the email worker, and deploy the Pages dashboard. Once it finishes, follow the [Email Routing](#4-configure-cloudflare-email-routing) step to connect your domain.

---

### Manual setup

---

#### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/mailpal
cd mailpal
npm install
cd email-worker && npm install && cd ..
```

---

#### 2. Create a KV namespace

```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create mailpal
```

Copy the `id` from the output and add it to **both** wrangler config files:

**`wrangler.toml`**
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "KV"
id = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID"
```

**`email-worker/wrangler.toml`**
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "KV"
id = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID"   # same ID as above
```

---

#### 3. Deploy the email worker

```bash
cd email-worker
wrangler deploy
```

Note the worker name — it defaults to `mailpal-email-worker`.

---

#### 4. Configure Cloudflare Email Routing

1. Go to **Cloudflare dashboard → your domain → Email → Email Routing**
2. Enable Email Routing if not already active
3. Under **Routing rules**, add a catch-all rule:
   - **Expression**: Catch-all
   - **Action**: Send to a Worker
   - **Worker**: `mailpal-email-worker`
4. Save the rule

> Email Routing requires your domain's MX records to point to Cloudflare. The dashboard will offer to update them automatically if needed.

---

#### 5. Deploy the dashboard

```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy
```

Wrangler will create a Pages project on first deploy and give you a `*.pages.dev` URL. To use a custom domain, go to **Cloudflare dashboard → Pages → your project → Custom domains**.

---

#### 6. Set a login password *(optional)*

```bash
wrangler pages secret put AUTH_PASSWORD
# Enter your password when prompted
```

Without this secret, the dashboard is unprotected. Use [Cloudflare Access](#protect-with-cloudflare-access) instead if you prefer SSO.

---

#### 7. Protect with Cloudflare Access *(optional alternative to password)*

1. Go to **Cloudflare dashboard → Zero Trust → Access → Applications**
2. Click **Add an application → Self-hosted**
3. Set the **Application domain** to your dashboard URL
4. Configure an identity provider and policy (e.g. allow your email address only)
5. Leave `AUTH_PASSWORD` unset — MailPal detects its absence and trusts CF Access headers

---

## Local development

To develop against a real KV namespace locally, use `wrangler pages dev`:

```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages dev --kv KV=YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID
```

To run the email worker locally:

```bash
cd email-worker
wrangler dev
```

> The app loads without Cloudflare services, but data operations require a real KV binding.

---

## Adding a domain

1. Open the dashboard and click **+** next to Domains in the sidebar
2. Enter your domain name (must be added to Cloudflare with Email Routing enabled)
3. Set a default target email address (where aliases forward by default)
4. Optionally enable **Wildcard mode**

After adding the domain, make sure the catch-all rule in Cloudflare Email Routing points to `mailpal-email-worker`.

---

## Environment variables

| Name | Where | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | Pages secret | Password for dashboard login. Omit to disable password auth. |
| `KV` | `wrangler.toml` binding | KV namespace shared between the dashboard and the email worker. |

---

## KV data schema

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `domain:{domain}` | `DomainConfig` JSON |
| `alias:{domain}/{localPart}` | `AliasConfig` JSON |
| `destination:{email}` | `DestinationAddress` JSON |
| `tag:{name}` | `Tag` JSON |
| `log:{domain}/{localPart}` | `LogEntry[]` JSON — ring buffer, last 50 entries |
| `settings:onboarded` | `"1"` when the onboarding flow has been completed |

You can inspect or edit values directly in the Cloudflare dashboard under **Workers & Pages → KV → your namespace**.
